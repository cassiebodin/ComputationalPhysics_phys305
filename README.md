# ComputationalPhysics_phys305
### Programs created while taking the upper level computational physics course (Phys305). All programs are in python. *Jan 2019-May 2019*

"FinalProject" contians the final project and presentation for this course. The final project was on utilizing code to recreate and model the Kirkwood gaps, areas in the asteroid belt that have been stripped of asteroids due to the orbital interactions between the asteroid, Jupiter, and the Sun. The code did this by generating asteroids randomly within the asteroid belt and determining if that asteroid's orbit was stable or unstable. If the orbit was stable then the location of the asteroid was recorded in a file. That file of stable asteroid orbits was used to generate a histogram that showed the gaps at certain radii.

"Homeworks" contains all the class homework assignments.

"InClassCoding" contains all the code snippets we worked on in class to gain a general knowledge of how to code many different scenarios to gain specific results.
